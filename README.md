# Basic Sims

This repository contains code to conduct a basic simulation study. The main point of this repo is for the user to gain familiarity with the idea of:

1) Generating simulation data

2) Analyzing simulation data

3) Collecting simulation results

The main file to start exploring is the `simulation_analysis.R` file in the `code` folder.
